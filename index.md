# What's the challenge?

Description goes here.

## Background

Over the past 3 years, humanitarian information analysts have been using an open source platform called DEEP to facilitate collaborative, and joint analysis of unstructured data. The aim of the platform is to provide insights from years of historical and in-crisis humanitarian text data. The platform allows users to upload documents and classify text snippets according to predefined humanitarian target labels, grouped into and referred to as analytical frameworks. DEEP is now successfully functional in several international humanitarian organizations and the United Nations across the globe.

While DEEP comes with a generic analytical framework, each organization may also create its own custom framework based on the specific needs of its domain. In fact, while there is a large conceptual overlap for humanitarian organizations, various domains define slightly different analytical frameworks to describe their specific concepts. These differences between the analytical frameworks in different domains can still contain various degrees of conceptual (semantic) linkages, for instance on sectors such as Food Security and Livelihoods, Health, Nutrition, and Protection.
